    A night-copy is a perfect replica of a nested list's box-and-pointer structure.
        If an environment diagram were drawn out, the two should be entirely
        separate but identical.

    A `zl` is a list that only contains ints and other lists.

    The function `night` generates a night-copy of the given list `zl`.

    Note: The `isinstance` function takes in a value and a type and determines
        whether the value is of the given type. So

        >>> isinstance("abc", str)
        True
        >>> isinstance("abc", list)
        False

    Here's an example, where night_y = night(y)
